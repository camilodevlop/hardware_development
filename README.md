# hardware_development

This repository contains the code of different electronic interaction devices. In some cases the photographic record is included. The devices were developed for people with physical disabilities in the upper extremities. For the development, the Arduino micro, the Teensy 3.2, the Bluetooth HCI RN-42, an inertial measurement unit, a joystick, and a set of electrodes were used. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and 3D printing were also used for the construction of the devices.
