Adaptation of interaction devices for people with physical disabilities in the upper limbs, Universidad Nacional de Colombia
Jan 2016 - Dec 2019

Three types of devices were developed to validate the adaptation model proposed in my doctoral thesis. The first one was called IMU-Mouse and its operation was based on head movements. The second type of device was a Joystick. Both prototypes could be programmed to perform the interaction actions of a pointing device. The last type was the keyboard. Particularly, two keyboards were developed -one with six keys and one with 18 keys-. The Keys could be programmed to perform any interaction action. The versatility of the previous prototypes to change both the form and the functionalities was used to adapt devices according to the interaction needs of the users.  All the adaptation processes were assisted by a group of engineers.


Tech stack: C++ -the language of the Arduino IDE is based on it-, Teensy 3.2 and Arduino Micro development boards, Bluetooth HCI RN-42, IMU MPU-9250 and Joystick Gravity V2.

Tools: Arduino IDE 1.8.5 and Teensyduino 1.58.

This repository contains the code of different electronic interaction devices. In some cases the photographic record is included. The devices were developed for people with physical disabilities in the upper extremities. For the development, the Arduino micro, the Teensy 3.2, the Bluetooth HCI RN-42, an inertial measurement unit, a joystick, and a set of electrodes were used. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and 3D printing were also used for the construction of the devices.
